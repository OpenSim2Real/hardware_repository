If the encoder code wheels require rework(see :ref`Robotic Leg Build Instructions <build_instructions_leg>`), 
then access to a well-equipped machine shop is required. This will be explained in greater detail in a later section, 
but avoiding rework of encoder code wheels by purchasing ready-made code wheels is recommended. Otherwise, access to the
following equipment is required:
* Lathe
* Milling machine

The following electrical tools are required:
* Soldering Station
* Thin solder wire
* Assorted Heat Shrink
* Wire Stripper
* Wire Cutter
* JST Crimper
