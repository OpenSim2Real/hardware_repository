Robotic Leg Build Instructions
==============================

Introduction
------------

The Robotic Leg is part of the complete Monopod, and the build instructions follows closely from 
the build instructions provided by the Open Dynamic Robot Initiative. However, several clarifying 
instructions have been added here to aid construction.

About the Open Dynamic Robot Initiative
---------------------------------------

The Open Dynamic Robot Initiative is a project by the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems to 
create a low cost, open source, robotics platform for researchers to experiment with legged actuation. 
ODRI's robotic platform consists of modular actuators which can be assembled in various configurations 
to serve different purposes. 

This project uses 2 such modular actuators, assembled into a 2-jointed Robotic Leg. Several modifications 
from the base design were made to facilitate connection with the Central Pivot assembly, but most of the 
assembly instructions remain unchanged. 

The ODRI-provided instructions are found here: 
* `ODRI Hardware Repository <https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/open_robot_actuator_hardware>`.

This section provides additional commentary and troubleshooting advice.

3D Printing Instructions
------------------------

ODRI has the following recommendations for 3D printing: 
* `3D Printed Parts Details <https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/open_robot_actuator_hardware/blob/master/mechanics/actuator_module_v1/details/details_3d_printed_parts.md#details-3d-printed-parts>`

The Robotic Leg requires the following STL parts to be printed. 
TODO: link to BOM 

Our team recommends the SLS process with Nylon 12 material to print all the parts. Our team recommends not 
using inexpensive FDM printers with the commonly available PLA material - some FDM printers do not have 
sufficient precision, and this will cause problems when fitting parts together. The PLA material also has 
a low glass transition temperature, which constitutes a risk of part deformation under high pressures or 
temperatures.

The STL files provided in our BOM have their holes and features offset by 0.2mm of radius. This ensures 
that all bearings and 3D printed parts will fit into each other with minimal application of force. 3D 
printers of inferior quality often overfill or underfill these features, therefore this modification to 
the STL files is necessary. STEP files without this feature modification are also provided in the BOM.

3D Printed Parts Preparation
----------------------------

ODRI has the following instructions for 3D printed parts preparation: 
* `Shell Preparation <https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/open_robot_actuator_hardware/blob/master/mechanics/actuator_module_v1/details/details_shell_preparation.md#details-shell-preparation>` and `Output Pulley Preparation <https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/open_robot_actuator_hardware/blob/master/mechanics/actuator_module_v1/details/details_output_pulley_preparation.md#details-output-pulley-preparation>`

Suggestions:
* If the 3D printed parts have their features adjusted as above, then the further modification of part dimensions 
  described by ODRI are no longer required, although some drilling of M2.5 and M3 holes to size might still be 
  necessary. When that has been completed, the described tapping of holes for M3 screws, and M2.5 and M3 
  helicoils can be started.

* Our team recommends printing dummy parts to practise tapping and helicoil insertion, before applying this 
  procedure on the real parts. This is important because an incorrectly inserted helicoil could cause an 
  actuator shell to not close properly.

Motor Shaft Preparation
-----------------------

ODRI has the following instructions for the motor shaft preparation: 
* `Encoder Disassembly <https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/open_robot_actuator_hardware/blob/master/mechanics/actuator_module_v1/details/details_encoder_kit_disassembly.md>`: Process to disassemble an encoder to get the encoder code wheel and the encoder electronics.
* `Machined Parts Preparation <https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/open_robot_actuator_hardware/blob/master/mechanics/actuator_module_v1/details/details_machined_parts.md#details-machined-parts>`: Instructions to get the necessary machined parts.
* `Motor Shaft Preparation < https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/open_robot_actuator_hardware/blob/master/mechanics/actuator_module_v1/details/details_motor_shaft_preparation.md#details-motor-shaft-preparation>`: Process to create a motor shaft assembly with the encoder code wheel

Suggestions:
* The motor shaft preparation steps are quite difficult to follow. The machined timing belt pulleys are difficult 
  and/or expensive to get and even more difficult to machine, and cutting the encoder disc down to size is also a 
  very difficult and delicate process. The motor shaft preparation guide also requires a lot of finessing to get right. 
* Instead, our team and ODRI, recommends buying a pre-built motor shaft here: 
  `PWB Encoders ODRI Kit <https://www.pwb-encoders.com/news/produkte/-/detail/news/plugplay-loesung-fuer-ein-open-source-roboter-projekt--12014>`. Our team recommends buying this early, and getting extras, because the lead time for this product can get quite long for North American users.

Encoder Preparation
-------------------

ODRI has the following instructions to prepare the encoders:
* `Encoder Preparation <https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/open_robot_actuator_hardware/blob/master/mechanics/actuator_module_v1/details/details_encoder_preparation.md#details-encoder-preparation>`

Suggestions:
* `As the wires will be connected to the 

Motor Preparation
-----------------

ODRI has the following instructions to prepare the motors:
* `Motor Preparation <https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/open_robot_actuator_hardware/blob/master/mechanics/actuator_module_v1/details/details_motor_preparation.md#details-motor-preparation>`

The instructions here are quite straightforward. However, the gold pins at the end should be substituted with 
these connectors:

TODO: image of what we got

Do not forget that the motor shaft is connected to the motor rotor by 2 threaded inserts. 
Make sure that those are removed before attempting to separate the motor shaft from the motor rotor, 
otherwise you risk shearing parts of the threaded insert, or the motor shaft.

Remember that when the BLDC motors were bought from the store, they came with a brass spacer. 
Make sure to keep these spacers safely, they are needed in the leg actuator assembly process!

Center Pulley Preparation
-------------------------

ODRI has the following instructions to prepare the center pulley:
* `Center Pulley <https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/open_robot_actuator_hardware/blob/master/mechanics/actuator_module_v1/details/details_center_pulley_preparation.md#details-center-pulley-preparation>`

It is important to ensure that the machined timing belt pulley is centered on the 3D-printed part and is vertical. 

Final assembly
--------------

At this point, the subcomponents have all been assembled and it is possible to put together the actuator. 

ODRI has the following instructions for the final assembly process:
* `Final Assembly Process <https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/open_robot_actuator_hardware/blob/master/mechanics/actuator_module_v1/details/details_actuator_module_assembly.md#details-actuator-module-assembly>`

The assembly process is similar for both the "hip" and "leg" actuator.

Suggestions: 

* Before closing the shells of the leg or hip actuators, ensure that the encoder disc, attached to the motor shaft, 
  is spinning freely and is not being scratched by the encoder reader or interfering with any other part. 
  If they are interfering, you must disassemble the encoder assembly again and correct for any misalignments which 
  may have caused the encoder disc to not spin freely. The tolerance is very tight; the encoder wheel must spin 
  within a ~3mm air space, so be very careful. 

* The bearings now might be a bit too loose for their bearing seats. If that is the case, then apply some thin tape 
  around the rim of the bearings until it is a snug fit.

* Before attaching the motors to the shell, make sure that the motor stator, rotor and shaft, as well as the shell, 
  are free of any magnetic and non-magnetic debris. Magnetic debris can be removed with strong tape.

* Make sure that the spinning 3D printed parts are clean of print artefacts, otherwise they might interfere with 
  non-spinning parts and cause friction. Protect all the bearings from debris, and donâ€™t apply a lot of axial force 
  on them, otherwise the bearings might have more friction than expected. If possible, use shielded bearings instead of 
  open bearings - this is totally worth it, even though the open bearings are cheaper.

Conclusion
----------

At the end of this section, there should be a single "hip" actuator, and a single "leg" actuator assembled. Do not 
attach them together yet, as testing requires that the
