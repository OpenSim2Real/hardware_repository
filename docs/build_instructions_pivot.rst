Introduction
------------

The Central Pivot is part of the complete Monopod, and its purpose is to constrain the Robotic Leg in a 2D plane. 
Unlike the Robotic Leg, however, the Central Pivot is an original design from OpenSim2Real. The following steps 
should be done in order, after all parts have arrived.

Waterjet Parts Preparation
--------------------------

If that has not been done already, waterjet the required parts in the BOM out of quarter-inch aluminum. Deburr 
all the edges of the waterjet cut pieces to avoid getting cut by sharp edges.

TODO: link to DXF files.

In the center hole of the baseplate, drill a countersink for a 1/4" screw. Tap the hole for a 1/4" screw. Test 
insert a 1/4" screw - a good fit should have the bolt sit flush so that the baseplate could lie flat on a table. 

Once a good fit on the 1/4" screw has been determined, loctite the bolt onto the baseplate.

3D Printed Parts Preparation
---------------------------

If not done already, 3D print the required parts in the BOM. The following parts should result: 

TODO: Link to DXF files, with images

Shaft-holder Preparation
------------------------

..image:: cp_images/shaft_holder_1.jpg

Insert one bushing into each end of each shaft-holder. Insert the 6mm diameter shaft into the shaft-holder with 
the bushings to check that the bushings are aligned within their housing. Superglue or epoxy the bushings into the 
shaft holders. 

..image:: cp_images/shaft_holder_2.jpg

Using a M2.5 helicoil tap, tap the 2 small holes on the shaft holders. Using a M2.5 helicoil insertion tool, 
insert M2.5 helicoils into these tapped holes. Using a M2.5 helicoil tang breakoff tool, break off the tangs 
inside the M2.5 helicoils. Repeat for both shaft holders.

Finally, secure the 3D printed shaft holders to the shaft-holder aluminum plates with 6-32 bolts and nuts.

Cylindrical Standoff Preparation
--------------------------------

Secure the cylindrical untreaded standoff on a tabletop vise. Tap a 1/4" hole on one end of the standoff, and 
screw the standoff onto the 1/4" screw protruding out of the baseplate. Ensure there is no gap between the 
standoff and the baseplate.

Upwards Assembly: Part 1
------------------------

The following parts are required for this step:
TODO: list of parts

Slide the first 3D printed collar piece down the cylindrical standoff on the baseplate, and ensure that it lies 
flat on the baseplate.

..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_3.jpg

Slide the wide thrust bearing around the 3D printed collar, and ensure that it lies flat on the baseplate.

..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_4.jpg

Slide the lowest aluminum platform around the 3D printed collar, and ensure that it lies flat on top of the thrust 
bearing. Slide the oilite flanged bushing around the cylindrical standoff until the flange lies flat on top of the lowest 
aluminum platform.

..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_5.jpg
..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_5_2.jpg

Slide the second 3D printed collar piece down the cylindrical standoff, and ensure that it lies flat on the 
lowest platform. Slide the second wide thrust bearing around the 3D printed collar, and ensure that it lies flat on the 
lowest platform.

..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_6.jpg

Slide the circular aluminum piece down the cylindrical standoff, and ensure that it lies flat on top of the 
thrust bearing.

..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_7.jpg
..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_7_2.jpg

Slide a wave spring and a 1/2" shaft collar down the cylindrical standoff. Applying pressure on top of the shaft 
collar, secure the shaft collar with the provided screws. This compresses the 2 thrust bearings, allowing the 
lowest aluminum platform to rotate freely, but remain constrained.

..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_8.jpg
..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_8_2.jpg

Using 4 1/4" OD screws, secure 4 threaded standoffs with length 1-1/2" onto the 4 holes on the lowest aluminum 
platform.

Shaft Preparation
-----------------

The following parts are required for this step:

TODO: Pictures

Slide the 6mm diamter aluminum shaft into the hole of the cylindrical standoff. Slide the second lowest aluminum 
plate on top of the 4 threaded standoffs of length 1-1/2". 

..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_9.jpg
..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_9_1.jpg
..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_9_2.jpg

With a fine marker, mark a point 14mm above the upper surface of the second lowest aluminum plate. This is the 
recommended length of the shaft such that it would fit inside the encoder in the next steps. Using a handsaw, 
cut the shaft at this length.

Insert the shorter segment of the shaft into the hole of the cylindrical standoff, and ensure that it is a loose 
fit. Layer the lower portion of the shaft with thin tape to ensure a tight fit. Slide this shaft into the 
cylindrical standoff and confirm a tight fit.

Finally, cut a segment of length 160mm out of the remaining 6mm diameter shaft.

Upwards Assembly: Part 2
------------------------

Slide the encoder base over the 6mm aluminum shaft. Secure it with 2 M2.5 bolts and nuts. 

..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_10.jpg

Secure the second lowest aluminum plate on top of the 4 threaded standoffs, with 4 more threaded standoffs with 
length 3/4". 

Slide the encoder cover over the 6mm aluminum shaft, and connect it to the encoder base. Following the instructions 
in the encoder manual, tighten the set-screw  connecting the encoder code wheel with the 6mm shaft, using the 
provided set-screw. After that, prime the encoder as per the instructions in the encoder manual.

..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_11.jpg
..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_11_2.jpg

On top of the topmost threaded standoffs, place the 2 shaft-holder aluminum plates. Secure these in place using 
4 threaded standoffs of length 3".

Shaft Alignment
---------------

Arrange the following components in the following order from left-to-right, leaving 14mm of shaft on one end of a 
shaft-holder.
- shaft-holder
- 6mm OD shaft collar clamp
- shaft collar clamp
- dowel-mount-lower
- 6mm OD shaft collar clamp
- shaft-holder

..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_14_3.jpg

Once it is confirmed that the above can be done, do it again, but epoxy the 6mm shaft onto the lower boom-holder.

After aligning the shaft such that there is 14mm of shaft on one end of a shaft-holder, screw in the shaft-collars. 
This locks the axial position of the shaft, while still allowing rotary motion.

Slide the encoder base over the 6mm aluminum shaft on one end of a shaft-holder, and secure it with 2 M2.5 screws.

Slide the encoder cover over the 6mm aluminum shaft, and connect it to the encoder base. 

..image:: cp_images/shaft_holder_5.jpg

Following the instructions in the encoder manual, tighten the set-screw  connecting the encoder code wheel with the 6mm shaft, using the 
provided set-screw. After that, prime the encoder as per the instructions in the encoder manual.

Upwards Assembly: Part 3
------------------------

Measure a point on the long aluminum boom about 20cm from one end, and apply a layer of duct tape around it. 
This adds friction to the aluminum boom, preventing it from rotating.

Connect the lower boom-holder and the upper boom-holder around the aluminum boom at the location of the duct tape, 
securing both ends with 4 10-32 bolts and locknuts.

..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_15.jpg
..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_15_2.jpg

Secure the upper aluminum plate on top of the 4 shaft-collars using 4 1/4" locknuts. 

..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_16.jpg
..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_16_2.jpg
..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_16_3.jpg

Secure 4 6-32 standoffs on top of the upper aluminum plate using 6-32 screws.

..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_16_4.jpg
..image:: cp_images/cp_stage_16_5.jpg

Secure the roof of the aluminum plate on top of the 4 6-32 standoffs using 6-32 screws.

Wiring the Central Pivot Encoders
---------------------------------

Measure out 2 5-wire cables of the 20cm length and cut them there.

At both ends, crimp JST connectors using the following wiring diagram:

TODO: Picture

Connect the TI boards to the encoders with these new cables.
