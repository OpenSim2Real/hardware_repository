Introduction
------------

The following tools and skills are required for successful construction of the Monopod.

Shop & Tool Requirements
------------------------

As far as possible, the tools required for successful construction are chosen to be 
readily available.

The following mechanical tools are required:
* Arbor Press
* Complete set of imperial and metric hex screwdrivers
* Complete set of imperial and metric cross screwdrivers
* Complete set of imperial and metric hole taps
* Complete set of drills
* Needlenose tweezers of various sizes
* Assorted Files & Sandpaper
* Mini-drill press
* M2.5 and M3 helicoil taps
* M2.5 and M3 helicoil insertion tools.
* M2.5 and M3 helicoil tang breakoff tools
* Handsaw
* Calipers
* Epoxy
* Loctite
* Masking Tape
* Kapton Tape, as thin as possible
* Tabletop Vise
* 3D printer (recommended)
* Waterjet cutter (recommended)

If the encoder code wheels require rework(see :ref`Robotic Leg Build Instructions <build_instructions_leg>`), 
then access to a well-equipped machine shop is required. This will be explained in greater detail in a later section, 
but avoiding rework of encoder code wheels by purchasing ready-made code wheels is recommended. Otherwise, access to the
following equipment is required:
* Lathe
* Milling machine

The following electrical tools are required:
* Soldering Station
* Thin solder wire
* Assorted Heat Shrink
* Wire Stripper
* Wire Cutter
* JST Crimper

Skill Requirements
------------------

The following mechanical assembly & design skills are required to assemble the physical robot:
- Familiarity with CAD software such as Onshape and SOLIDWORKS
- Waterjet cutting
- 3D printing
- Drilling and tapping holes
- Insertion of Helicoils

The following electrical skills are required to assemble the physical robot:
- Soldering and Wiring
- Measurement with oscilloscope and multimeter
- Wire crimping for JST connectors
- Reading electrical schematics

The following software skills are required to setup the code infrastructure for the physical robot:
- Python, C, C++ programming languages
- Familiarity with Windows and Linux OS
- Git version control
- Embedded software development
- Familiarity with Field Oriented Control

This build assumes the availability of computers running Ubuntu 20.04 and Windows 10 operating systems.
