If the encoder code wheels require rework(see :ref`Robotic Leg Build Instructions <build_instructions_leg>`),
then access to a well-equipped machine shop is required. This will be explained in greater detail in a later section,
but avoiding rework of encoder code wheels by purchasing ready-made code wheels is recommended. Otherwise, access to the
following equipment is required:
- Lathe
- Milling machine

The following electrical tools are required:
- Soldering Station
- Thin solder wire
- Assorted Heat Shrink
- Wire Stripper
- Wire Cutter
- JST Crimper

Skill Requirements
------------------

The following mechanical assembly & design skills are required to assemble the physical robot:
- Familiarity with CAD software such as Onshape and SOLIDWORKS
- Waterjet cutting
- 3D printing
- Drilling and tapping holes
- Insertion of Helicoils

The following electrical skills are required to assemble the physical robot:
- Soldering and Wiring
- Measurement with oscilloscope and multimeter
- Wire crimping for JST connectors
- Reading electrical schematics

The following software skills are required to setup the code infrastructure for the physical robot:
- Python, C, C++ programming languages
- Familiarity with Windows and Linux operating systems. A dual-booted laptop with Windows 10/11 and Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 or PopOS, a decent processor and at least 8GB of RAM is recommended.
- Git version control
- Embedded software development
- Familiarity with Field Oriented Control for motors.

This build assumes the availability of computers running Ubuntu 20.04 and Windows 10 operating systems.
Learning resources to gain familiarity with the necessary toolchains and techniques are in
:ref`Further Reading & Resources <monopod_resources>`.
